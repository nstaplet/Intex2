            <h4>DISCOVERIES FOR THE WORLD TO SEE</h4>
            <p>Fag el-Gamous (which means Way of the Water Buffalo) is a large and important cemetery in Egypt that has been under archeological investigation (primarily by BYU researchers) for over 25 years. 
            The excavation has garnered international attention because of the interesting insights gained by studying the Fag el-Gamous mummies.</p>

            <h4>RESEARCHER ACCESS</h4>
            <p>During multiple years of study, researchers have excavated more than 1,000 mummies and collected data in field notes, spreadsheets,
            and simple databases about each mummy’s location, physical orientation in the ground, burial depth, 
            hair color, wrapping , gender, age, bone
            dimensions, items accompanying the mummy, and more. </p>

                    Less than 1% of all burials are found with a cross symbol, either as textile images or objects and none are found deeper than 1 m. 
                    Burial NE10 has two 7 cm square multi-colored cross symbols embroidered in one of the inner layers of clothing. 
                    The radiocarbon date of NE10 should provide evidence for one of the earliest uses of a Christian symbol in this cemetery.
                    Because crosses were not used as Christian symbols in the earliest phases of Christianity, a cross-laden burial cannot tell us about the timing of the advent of Christianity. 
                    It can provide a date that represents the latest possible time for the advent of a Christian presence in the population of the cemetery.

                <p>The 1000 + burials excavated to date at the cemetery are found largely in rectangular shafts at 0.3–3.0 m deep and oriented on an east–west axis.
                The high burial density, varying between 1.3 and 3.0 burials per square meter, is due in part to multiple burials in the same shaft. 
                The stratigraphically deepest burials in a shaft are buried head east and later burials in the same shaft are buried head west.
                It has been argued that this directional shift occurred as early as the late first to the early second century AD.
                AMS radiocarbon dating of the available samples shows that the deepest and presumably oldest head-east burial dates to AD 79–230, and the oldest head-west burial dates to AD 128–284. 
                One of the deepest signs of Christianity, a cross symbol, is present in the outer wrapping of a burial dated AD 545–645.
                The head-east and head-west burial practices in the Fag el-Gamous cemetery coexisted for at least 200 years.</p>
